# cortex_vision_app

Cortex Vision is a mobile application developed using Flutter to predict the likelihood of cataracts based on eye images.

## About Cortex Vision

Cortex Vision leverages machine learning algorithms to provide users with a preliminary assessment of potential cataracts. Users can upload images of their eyes, which are then analyzed by a remote machine learning backend to determine the probability of cataract presence.

**Key Features:**

* **Image-Based Cataract Prediction:** Allows users to upload eye images for analysis.
* **Powered by Remote ML Backend:** The application communicates with a separate Python-based machine learning system for prediction.
* **Flask API for Communication:** Utilizes a Flask API to establish communication between the Flutter mobile app and the machine learning backend.

**Important Note:** The predictions generated by Cortex Vision are intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.

## Getting Started

This project is a Flutter application. To run it, ensure you have Flutter SDK installed on your development machine.

**Prerequisites:**

* [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) installed and configured.

**Running the App:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Ibtasam-98/cortex_vision_app.git](https://github.com/Ibtasam-98/cortex_vision_app.git)
    cd cortex_vision_app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    This command will build and run the application on your connected device or emulator.

## Machine Learning Backend

The machine learning algorithms responsible for cataract prediction are implemented in Python and are hosted in a separate repository:

* **ML Repository:** [https://github.com/Ibtasam-98/cortex_vision.git](https://github.com/Ibtasam-98/cortex_vision.git)

This backend system utilizes a Flask API to receive eye images from the Cortex Vision mobile application and return the prediction results.

**Key aspects of the backend:**

* **Python ML Implementation:** The core machine learning logic for image analysis and prediction is written in Python.
* **Trained Models:** Employs machine learning models specifically trained for cataract detection.
* **Flask API Endpoint:** Provides a Flask API endpoint that the mobile app uses to send images and receive predictions.

**Note:** To ensure the Cortex Vision mobile application functions correctly, the backend Flask API from the linked repository must be set up and running. Refer to the documentation within the backend repository for instructions on how to deploy and run the API.
